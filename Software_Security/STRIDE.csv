49,Spoofing of Destination Data Store app-db,Spoofing,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,app-db may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being written to the attacker's target instead of app-db. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination data store.,,Generated
50,Potential SQL Injection Vulnerability for app-db,Tampering,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.,,Generated
51,Potential Excessive Resource Consumption for express nodejs or app-db,Denial Of Service,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,"Does express nodejs or app-db take explicit steps to control resource consumption? Resource consumption attacks can be hard to deal with, and there are times that it makes sense to let the OS do the job. Be careful that your resource requests don't deadlock, and that they do timeout.",,Generated

54,Elevation Using Impersonation,Elevation Of Privilege,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,keycloak may be able to impersonate the context of express nodejs in order to gain additional privilege.,,Generated
53,express nodejs Process Memory Tampered,Tampering,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,"If express nodejs is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what keycloak executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then express nodejs can tamper with keycloak. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it.",,Generated
73,Potential Data Repudiation by express nodejs,Repudiation,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,"express nodejs claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.",,Generated

72,Cross Site Scripting,Tampering,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,The web server 'express nodejs' could be a subject to a cross-site scripting attack because it does not sanitize untrusted input.,,Generated
71,Potential Lack of Input Validation for express nodejs,Tampering,Diagram 1,HTTP,High,Not Started,,Data flowing across HTTP may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against express nodejs or an elevation of privilege attack against express nodejs or an information disclosure by express nodejs. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.,,Generated
